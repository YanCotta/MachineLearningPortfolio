# MachineLearningPortfolio
This repository showcases my growing expertise in machine learning and AI. It includes projects demonstrating core algorithms and techniques, such as regression, classification, clustering, NLP, Deep Learning, and others. Each project is accompanied by detailed documentation to highlight objectives, methodologies, and insights gained.

## Projects Overview
Below is a high-level summary of each sub-folder, with more details available in their respective README.md files.

### 1. Unsupervised Learning
- **kmeans_and_hierarchical_clusterings**  
  Mall customer segmentation using K-Means & Hierarchical clustering.  
  (See: /unsupervised/kmeans_and_hierarchical_clusterings/README.md)

- **association_rule_apriori_eclat**  
  Market basket analysis with Apriori & ECLAT algorithms.  
  (See: /unsupervised/association_rule_apriori_eclat/README.md)

### 2. Supervised Learning
- **Regression**  
  Multiple regression models (Linear, Polynomial, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
  (See: /supervised/Regression/README.md)

- **Classification**  
  Various classification templates (Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
  (See: /supervised/Classification/README.md)

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **upper_confidence_bound(ucb)**  
  Implements the UCB algorithm for ad selection.  
  (See: /reinforcement/upper_confidence_bound(ucb)/README.md)

- **thompson_sampling**  
  Demonstrates Thompson Sampling for choosing optimal ads.  
  (See: /reinforcement/thompson_sampling/README.md)

### 4. NLP
- Simple example of text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization & stopword removal.  
  (See: /nlp/README.md)

### 5. Data Preprocessing
- Common steps like handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.  
  (See: /data_preprocessing/README.md)

## Getting Started
