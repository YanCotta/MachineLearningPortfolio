## 📊 Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Logistic Regression (`logistic_regression.py`)
- Basic binary classification algorithm
- Best for: Linear relationships, binary outcomes
- Advantages: Simple, interpretable, computationally efficient
- Limitations: Cannot handle non-linear relationships well

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (`k_nearest_neighbors.py`) 
- Instance-based learning method
- Best for: Small to medium datasets with clear patterns
- Advantages: No training phase, handles non-linear data
- Limitations: Computationally expensive for large datasets

### 3. Support Vector Machine (`support_vector_machine.py`)
- Linear classification with maximum margin
- Best for: High-dimensional data, clear margins between classes
- Advantages: Effective in high dimensions, memory efficient
- Limitations: Not suitable for large datasets

### 4. Kernel SVM (`kernel_svm.py`)
- Non-linear classification using kernel trick
- Best for: Complex non-linear relationships
- Advantages: Can handle non-linear data effectively
- Limitations: Computationally intensive

### 5. Naive Bayes (`naive_bayes.py`)
- Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- Best for: Text classification, spam filtering
- Advantages: Fast, efficient with high-dimensional data
- Limitations: Assumes feature independence

### 6. Decision Tree (`decision_tree_classification.py`)
- Tree-structured classifier
- Best for: Cases requiring interpretable results
- Advantages: Easy to understand, visualize
- Limitations: Can overfit, unstable

### 7. Random Forest (`random_forest_classification.py`)
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Best for: Complex classification tasks
- Advantages: High accuracy, handles overfitting
- Limitations: Less interpretable, computationally intensive

## 💻 Example Usage

```python
from templates import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
X, y = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize classifier with optimal settings
clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=None,
    min_samples_split=2,
    random_state=42
)

# Train and evaluate with cross-validation
scores = clf.train_evaluate(X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Cross-validation accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.2f})")
```
